# Django Commons

Django Commons is an organization dedicated to supporting the
community's efforts to maintain packages. It seeks to improve the
maintainence experience for all contributors; reducing the barrier
to entry for new contributors and reducing overhead for existing
maintainers.

Django Commons has lofty goals for the future, but will only be
possible with your help:

- Compensate maintainers
- Identify and announce packages needing help
- Normalize and support maintainers periodically stepping back
- Support and encourage new contributors to step up
